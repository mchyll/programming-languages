payment(Sum, Coins) :-
    % Pattern-match the topmost coin from the Coins list
    Coins = [coin(AmountOfCoinsNeeded, ValueOfCoin, AmountOfCoinsAvailable)|CoinsTail],
    % AmountOfCoinsNeeded can be between 0 and AmountOfCoinsAvailable
    AmountOfCoinsNeeded in 0..AmountOfCoinsAvailable,
    % The current coin plus the rest of the coins must equal Sum
    Sum #= AmountOfCoinsNeeded * ValueOfCoin + TailSum,
